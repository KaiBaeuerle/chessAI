This project was created out of interest in chess and AlphaZero. The project is not finished yet and uses a slightly modified way of the MinMax alogrithm with alpha-beta pruning.
During each game data is collected to improve the AI.
To play against the AI or another player you have to set playerOne/playerTwo to true/false in the ChessMain class.
